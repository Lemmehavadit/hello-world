      <h1>About GrinBound</h1>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        GrinBound turns a simple hat into a lasting friendship, bridging the social divide for children with special needs through the shared joy of creation.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Too often, the education of disabled children happens in parallel to that of their peers, leaving them seen as 'others' and tragically alone. When their classmates graduate and move on, these children can become homebound, facing a future of isolation, especially after their parents are no longer able to care for them.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Solution: Inclusivity Caps</h2>
      <p>
        The Inclusivity Caps project creates a lasting memory embodied in a fashion accessoryâ€”a symbol of connection across the divide. It's a simple, powerful way to show all students that love is love, and we are not as different as we are often led to believe.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Vision for the Future</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where the "Inclusivity Captain" is a standard role in student governments, where kids with big hearts are empowered to enrich the lives of their peers. Through these high-value activities, students with disabilities can form genuine friendships, creating a community of empathetic souls who will look out for them long after graduation. This provides parents with the peace of mind that their child will be cared for by a community, not locked away from the world.
