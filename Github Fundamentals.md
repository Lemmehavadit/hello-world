Date of Session: June 22, 2025
Subject: GitHub Fundamentals

This session log details your journey from initial setup to a successful execution of the core Git workflow. You navigated several real-world configuration challenges, demonstrating significant persistence.

Session Timeline & Key Events:

Approx. 4:06 PM CDT: Session begins. Curriculum for "GitHub Mastery" is established.
Approx. 4:11 PM CDT: You began the Git installation process on your MacBook, successfully using the built-in Xcode Command Line Tools after troubleshooting initial download speed estimates.
Approx. 4:21 PM CDT: git config was successfully run to set your user.name and user.email, identifying you to your local Git installation.
Approx. 4:27 PM CDT: You created your first remote repository, hello-world, on GitHub.com and cloned it to your local machine.
Approx. 4:38 PM CDT: You made your first local commit after modifying the README.md file.
Approx. 4:44 PM CDT: You encountered your first major challenge: git push failed due to password authentication being deprecated.
Approx.4:48 PM CDT: You successfully generated a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub to use for command-line authentication.
Approx. 4:51 PM CDT: You encountered your second major challenge: The push was rejected due to GitHub's email privacy protection feature.
Approx. 5:17 PM CDT: After targeted troubleshooting to re-configure your local Git email and amend the previous commit, you successfully executed your first git push.
Approx. 5:29 PM CDT: You completed the final practice exercise for Module 1, creating a new file (Learning.txt) and pushing it to your remote repository smoothly.
Approx. 5:32 PM CDT: Module 1 officially completed.
Core Concepts & Study Notes:

Git vs. GitHub:

Git is the version control software on your computer. It tracks changes and manages history through commits.
GitHub is the website that hosts your Git repositories. It's built for collaboration, sharing, and project management.
The Holy Trinity of Commands (The Core Workflow):

git add <file>: This command takes a modified file and puts it into a "staging area." You are telling Git, "Prepare this change for the next snapshot."
git commit -m "Your message": This takes everything in the staging area and saves it as a permanent snapshot (a commit) in your project's history. The message (-m) is a mandatory description of what changed.
git push: This command uploads your new local commits from your computer to the remote repository on GitHub.
Key Terminology:

Repository (Repo): A folder containing your project and its entire history.
Clone: To create a local copy of a remote repository from GitHub onto your machine.
Commit: A saved snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
Branch (main): The primary timeline of your project's history.
Critical Setup & Troubleshooting Lessons:

Authentication: git push via HTTPS no longer uses your GitHub password. You must use a Personal Access Token (PAT) which acts as a secure key for applications.
Email Privacy: GitHub protects your email address. Your local git config user.email must match an email known to GitHub or use the special ...@users.noreply.github.com address to successfully push changes.
The Command Feedback Loop: The git status command is your most important tool. It tells you the current state of your repository, what has changed, and what needs to be done next. You successfully used it to guide your actions throughout the lesson.
