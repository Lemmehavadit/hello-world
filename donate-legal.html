      <h2>Help Us Achieve 501(c)(3) Status</h2>
      <p>
        Achieving 501(c)(3) non-profit status is the single most important step to ensure the long-term success and legitimacy of GrinBound. 
        This official designation makes all future donations tax-deductible for our supporters and opens up opportunities for grants and corporate partnerships.
      </p>
      <p>
        The funds raised on this page are dedicated exclusively to paying for the required 501(c)(3) application fees and the associated legal costs for professional review.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please note:</strong> As we are not yet a 501(c)(3), your contribution on this page is a direct gift to the cause and is not tax-deductible at this time.
      </p>
