<h1>Support Inclusivity Caps</h1>

<h2>Important Information About Your Contribution</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Please note:</strong> GrinBound is in the process of applying for 501(c)(3) non-profit status. 
  Until our application is approved, contributions are not tax-deductible.
</p>
<p>
  To support our mission during this phase, we offer a way for you to directly fund the materials for our program. 
  When you contribute, you are technically purchasing a digital, heartwarming photo from us. 
  The funds from these purchases will be used exclusively to buy plain white hats and colored Sharpies for the children.
